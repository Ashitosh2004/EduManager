Generate a React.js app using Firebase free-tier (Auth, Firestore, FCM) with the following features:

1. Institute Selection:
   - Dropdown list of registered institutes (from Firestore).
   - User must select institute before login.

2. Authentication:
   - Firebase Auth (Email + Password, Google Sign-In).
   - Restrict login to faculty emails ending with the selected institute domain.
   - Only faculty role allowed.

3. Home Page:
   - Show 4 main containers: Students, Faculty, Courses, Timetable Generator.

4. Student Manager:
   - Navigate: Department → Class → Add/Remove Students.
   - Store student info in Firestore.

5. Faculty Manager:
   - Navigate: Department → Add/Remove Faculty.
   - Assign multiple classes and subjects to one faculty (e.g., Prof. Sharma → CSE-A, CSE-B).
   - Store assignments in Firestore.

6. Course Manager:
   - Navigate: Department → Add/Remove Course.
   - Add assignments and marks to each course.
   - Store in Firestore.

7. Timetable Generator:
   - Select: Subject, Teacher, Class, Room.
   - Prevent conflicts using Firestore checks:
     - One teacher cannot be double-booked in same time slot.
     - Rooms cannot be double-booked.
     - Teacher must belong to assigned classes.
   - Save generated timetable to Firestore.
   - Export timetable as PDF/Excel using open-source npm libraries.

8. UI/UX:
   - Use Material UI or Tailwind CSS for modern responsive design.
   - Provide Dark/Light mode.
   - Role-based dashboard navigation.

9. General:
   - State management with Context API or Redux Toolkit.
   - Firestore collections: institutes, faculty, students, courses, timetable.
   - Notifications for faculty via Firebase Cloud Messaging.
   - Documentation: inline comments + README with setup.

Deliverables:
- Full React.js code with structured folders (components, context, services, pages).
- Firestore schema as defined.
- Dummy dataset for testing (students, faculty, courses).
